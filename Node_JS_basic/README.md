# Node.js Basics ‚Äì Holberton School

This project introduces the fundamentals of **Node.js** for backend development.
You will learn how to run JavaScript using Node, use Node.js modules, build small HTTP servers, and set up an Express.js application with Babel and Nodemon for development.

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Run JavaScript using Node.js
- Use Node.js built-in modules
- Use the `fs` module to read files
- Use the `process` object to access command line arguments and environment variables
- Create a small HTTP server using **Node.js**
- Create a small HTTP server using **Express.js**
- Create advanced routes with **Express.js**
- Use ES6 with Node.js via Babel
- Use **Nodemon** to auto-restart the server during development
