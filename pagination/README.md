# Pagination Project

## Description
This project implements different pagination techniques in Python, focusing on:
- Simple page and page_size parameters
- Pagination with hypermedia metadata
- Deletion-resilient pagination

The goal is to understand and apply REST API pagination strategies, starting with basic helper functions and progressing toward robust and scalable solutions.

1. How to paginate a dataset with simple `page` and `page_size` parameters.
2. How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
3. How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.
